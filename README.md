# part-hm-regressor
this is my modification of works combining Stacked Hourglass Networks for Human Pose Estimation and Human pose estimation via Convolutional Part Heatmap Regression on Human Pose Estimation.

The code is mostly based on [Stacked Hourglass Networks for Human Pose Estimation](https://github.com/anewell/pose-hg-train), now it is on construction.
