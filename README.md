# part-hm-regressor
this is my modification of works combining Stacked Hourglass Networks for Human Pose Estimation and Human pose estimation via Convolutional Part Heatmap Regression on Human Pose Estimation.

The code is largely based on code of [Stacked Hourglass Networks for Human Pose Estimation](https://github.com/anewell/pose-hg-train), and now it is on debugging.
